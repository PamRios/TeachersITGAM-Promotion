# Introduction
This step shows a summary of the steps followed for the creation of the project and the repository in GitHub.

# Methods

For the creation of this project are used as a basis **NodeJS, Express, JavaScript** and of course the different general elements for web projects (HTML, CSS, etc.), this work has an empirical basis so that during its development the sources of consultation, advice, recommendations, were frequently changed or updated.

# Results

- Initially it is necessary to have or, failing that, to create an account in GithHub.
- The next thing to do is to select what type of project and what tools will be used for that project.
- Now a new Codespace is created

# Discussions

Let's start by saying that this process of working directly in GitHUb not only allows greater security, but also greater fluidity when working, since by creating a repository dedicated or oriented to a language or module, it contains the basic tools necessary to avoid the developer to manually create folders one by one, It is well known that doing things from scratch has a great impact on learning, however, automating and simplifying the most basic tasks also contains a great help to face the reality of the life of a professional, in this case of a Full Stack developer.

# References
For this first stage the only references used are the lectures taken about the Full Stack Development II course (taken face-to-face) and the lecture notes provided by the course holder.
