# Introduction

ES6 or ECMAScript 2015 is the 6th version of the ECMAScript programming language. ECMAScript is the standardization of Javascript which was released in 2015, and subsequently renamed as ECMAScript 2015.

This file describes the changes that were made from "old" JS to modern JS

# Methods

As main triggers of change we used a [ES6 course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript) offered on the FreeCodeCamp platform, as well as the [updated](https://github.com/rivalcoba/projnotes-2023a-class/commit/5425772d56effdf4e0ef9945da231b58e0591ebf) code from the instructor of the classroom course: Full Stack Development II.

# Results

The main changes focus on modifying the writing of the code from something old to the most modern.

Let's see what these changes are:

The reserved words _var_ were replaced by _constant_ that allow to make a variable cannot be declared again and its content can be used as a constant.

The _require_ were replaced by _imports_.

While exports of e.g., a single variable or object were now performed with _export default_ which through the variable name makes it the same as the exported one by default.
