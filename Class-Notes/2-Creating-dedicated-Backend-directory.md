# Introduction

For a better understanding of the code and how it works, the following describes how to make a folder that will contain all the server part.

# Methods

As mentioned before [1](https://github.com/PamRios/projnotes-firsttime/blob/main/Class-Notes/1-Project-Creation.md) this project is done in an empirical way, constant trial and error, the main guide of realization was the instructor of the classroom course Full Stack Web Development II.

# Results

- Create a folder called Server

- Put the folders Views, Routes inside the Server folder.

# Discussions

To develop a Full Stack project, it is necessary to know back end and front end, for good practices in the present project a directory dedicated only to the Backend part is created, as mentioned in the steps of the last section.

in the steps of the last section, in this directory are stored the different folders that have to do with the server and its routes.
